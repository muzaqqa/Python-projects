Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to create a simple face detection system. The program works by using a pre-trained face detection model called a Haar Cascade, which is essentially a file containing instructions on how to recognize patterns that look like a face.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

The program accesses your computer's camera to capture live video.
Each frame of the video is analyzed to detect any faces.
When a face is detected, a green rectangle is drawn around it, making it easy to see in real time.
This is a fun and practical example of how computers can "see" and recognize objects in images or videos. Whether you're just starting out with computer vision or exploring real-world applications of AI, this project is a great place to start!
